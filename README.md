### Key Feautes 🔑

1. **T-Shirt Customization**: The platform allows users to customize T-shirt designs by selecting various options. Users can change the color of the T-shirt using a color picker, providing a wide range of color choices to suit their preferences.

2. **Logo and Pattern Upload**: Users have the ability to upload their own images or graphics to use as logos or patterns on the T-shirt. This feature enables users to add a personal touch and incorporate their unique designs into the customization process.

3. **AI-Generated Designs**: The project integrates with the OpenAI DALL·E API, enabling users to generate AI-generated patterns and logos for their T-shirt designs. The platform provides an interface where users can input their preferences or keywords, and the DALL·E API generates visually appealing and unique designs based on the given input.

4. **Real-Time Visualizations**: Three.js, a JavaScript library for 3D graphics, is utilized to create a real-time visualization of the T-shirt designs. Users can see an interactive representation of the T-shirt with their selected colors, uploaded logos or patterns, and AI-generated designs, providing them with a preview of the final product.

5.**User Accounts and Order Management** : The platform includes user account functionality, allowing users to create accounts, save their custom designs, and manage their orders. Users can review and modify their designs before finalizing their orders for production.
